We are the people is a website where nature and earth advocates can find a platform to support causes that backs up these topics. The website starts with a list of all current causes to support on the home page. Users who show interest in some of these causes will be prompted to sign in or create a new account in order to make a monetary donation of their choice. I they choose to do so and; after a successful login, they’ll have access to the donations page where they can either choose an amount from a preset list or enter a different amount.
When a donation is made, all donations will be listed on the main page of that particular cause along with the donor’s name and the timestamp of each donation. Similarly; all donations made by a particular advocate will be listed on that advocate's account page.
Users will; of course, be able to delete their account if they elected to do so at any time, but their names will still be listed on causes they’ve previously made a donation to. That said, not everyone has the ability to create new causes or edit/ delete existing ones. This is the responsibility of the site admin who can use special kinds of credentials to sign in in order to carry on these administrative tasks.
